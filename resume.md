# individual
## puzzles (see individual_result-distribution-per-round.png)
- difficulty in prelims: ACD easier, BEF harder (or not trained as much)
    - based on the averages
- looking at puzzles A,C,D: C was harder for slow people
    - A+C have same average time but less people finished C -> more outliers
    - C+D have same finisher percentage but average faster on C -> more outliers
- being able to train makes averages catch up to tops and slows catch up to averages more / unreleased puzzles show strengths and weaknesses more
    - for the unreleased puzzles you see a different pattern in the result distribution:
    - prelims linear -> the times increased linear
    - for unreleased rather cubic shape -> in the first and last places you have bigger margins and around the average people are more similar
## scores (explanation see excel sheet)
- Kristin Thuv wins all scores (avg_placement, avg_time=00:33:12, score_on_unreleased, overall_score) except score_before_final
- top 4 by expectation before the finals would've been (each with solid margin)
    1. Katharina Reiner
    2. Kristin Thuv
    3. Alejandro Clemente León
    4. Mercédesz Arthofer
    - then follow many people with alomst equal scores
- within the final top 20: biggest jumps made 
    - Kelly Walter (+12), 
    - Katrina Coleman (+23),
    - Klara Wesselkamp (+46!),
    - Melissa Townsend (+13),
    - Cathy Roiter (+19)
- within the expected top 20: biggest drops made
    - Markéta Freislerová (expected:6,-15), 
    - Gisela Arranz Toro (9,-48), 
    - Mari Black (13,-28), 
    - Kateřina Klinková (14,-33), 
    - Sofie Juel Andersen (18,-30)
- only 2 people in the finals placed as expected: Chiara Dellantonio (11), Rhianna Eriksen (46) 
- fastest relative time was Katharina Reiner => 41.22% of the time the average person puzzled
## did the average WJPC-participant get faster
- did the average WJPC-finalist get faster? (I would say yes, all final puzzles were of similar difficulty)
    - 2022 1:08:27, 2023 1:04:35, 2024 0:58:09
- average qualification time needed
    - 2022 1:20:20, 2023 1:18:43, 2024 1:01:33
    - doesn't necessarily mean people got faster -> less people qualifying (60 of 190 vs 60 of 80) biases this evolvment

# pair
## puzzles (see pair_result-distribution-per-round.png)
- difficulty in prelims: BD easier, AC way harder
- D was practiced more / has more faster pairs than B
    - while B and D average is 5 minutes difference, the qualifiying threshhold is 10 minutes difference (D faster than B)
- all pairs in the final were amazing (also depends on the used images as always)
    - the avg solving time of the final (1000p) was nearly the same to prelim A and C (500p)
    - all pairs finished in the final, whereas less than 50% finished the prelims
- linear vs cubic shape analog to individual
## scores 
- not as obvious as in individual:
    - fastest avg_time Gisela Arranz Toro / Alejandro Clemente León (0.00:31:36) only three sec faster than Tereza Koptíková / Markéta Freislerová
    - best individual combined score Katharina Reiner / Chiara Dellantonio
    - top 5 by expectation based on performance before the finals would've been 
        1. Gisela Arranz Toro / Alejandro Clemente León (by quite a margin 0.03)
        2. Tereza Koptíková / Markéta Freislerová
        3. Natalia Ptaszek / Wiktor Kacprzak, Melissa Townsend / Hannah Farthing, Becca Taylor / Alice Rowe (less than 0.001 difference among those three pairs)
        - very much biased by puzzles of qualifying round -> BC vs AD
- fastest relative time was Gisela Arranz Toro / Alejandro Clemente León => 41,00% of the time the average pair puzzled
### individual_combined_score (ics)
- top 5 by expectation based on individual performance would've been
    1. Katharina Reiner / Chiara Dellantonio
    2. Tereza Koptíková / Markéta Freislerová
    3. Kelly Walter / Andrea Peng (prediction hit)
    4. Gisela Arranz Toro / Alejandro Clemente León (prediction hit)
    5. Melissa Townsend / Hannah Farthing
- within the final top 10: biggest jumps made 
    - Kristin Thuv / Linda Bremnes Anderssen (+7), 
    - Natalia Ptaszek / Wiktor Kacprzak (+6)
- within the expected top 25: no pair dropped more than 5 places compared to ics predicition
- Ana Isabel Jimeno Jordá / Ana Gil Luciano with ics 0.99 (= one of the most average pairs) were 22
### participation also in individuals
- no pair with a participant who didnt also puzzle in individual final made it into top 25, 4 in top 50
- only one pair where both members didnt also puzzle in individual final made it into the finals (Claire Thomas / Chloe Muellers, place 86)
## did the average WJPC-pair get faster
- did the average WJPC-finalist get faster? (strongly biased by puzzle difficulty (23 super hard, 24 super easy) , no trend visible)
    - 2022 1:49:03, 2023 1:04:35, 2024 0:58:09
- average qualification time needed (strongly biased by puzzle difficulty (23 all hard, 24 very mixed), no trend visible)
    - 2022 0:55:51, 2023 0:59:14, 2024 0:58:32

# team
(- i didn't look into the different puzzles of the prelims yet, so all interpretations here are on the combined times of both chosen puzzles only; this is a whole different story, also regarding the impact of the puzzle choice; so I'll also only list comparison to ics here because the score_before_final is also highly impacted by puzzle/strategy choice in prelims)
## puzzles (see team_result-distribution-per-round.png)
- difficulty in the prelims strongly decreased from A to C + also to the final
## scores
- top 5 by expectation based on ics would've been
    1. Tereza Koptíková / Markéta Freislerová / Kateřina Klinková / Jana Ondroušková
    2. Hannah Farthing / Melissa Townsend / Katrina Coleman / Rhianna Eriksen
    3. Gisela Arranz Toro / Elisa Toro Arévalo / Elena Pavía Martínez-Pardo / Ana Tiessen Nogueira (that score's broken because only Gisela has an individual performance)
    4. Vanda Varga / Mercédesz Arthofer / Brigitta Pozsa / Brigitta Vinkler
    5. Andrea Peng / Jeanne Roiter / Cathy Roiter / Becca Taylor
- within the final top 10: biggest jumps made 
    - Karen Kavett / Tiffany Medeiros / Kelly Walter / Katherine Dilks (+8)
    - S J Bodell / Katharina Reiner / Emilia Korhonen / Christina Reiner (+34)
    - Ana Gil Luciano / Ana Isabel Jimeno Jordá / Alejandro Clemente León / David Caballero Calzado (+12)
    - Valentina Baburchenkova / Natalia Komarova / Mariia Matiushkina / Taisiya Voronova (+32)
- also Kristin's team had a big jump 
    - so I think we can say that 1 very strong puzzler in a team (Alejandro, Kristin, Kathi) _can_ extremely outweigh slower team members
## other
- 6/10 teams in the top 10 are prelim C, 2 B, 2 A
    - being in prelim A and having a less stressful Saturday was not an advantage (at least for teams + only based on numbers obviously)
## did the average WJPC-team get faster 
(- 22 is not listed because different puzzle size)
- did the average WJPC-finalist get faster? 
    - 2023 1:49:03, 2024 1:56:35
- average qualification time needed 
    - 2023 2:57:36, 2024 2:43:05
