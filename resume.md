# individual
## puzzles (see individual_result-distribution-per-round.png)
- difficulty in prelims: ACD easier, BEF harder (or not trained as much)
    - based on the averages
- looking at puzzles A,C,D: C was harder for slow people
    - A+C have same average time but less people finished C -> more outliers
    - C+D have same finisher percentage but average faster on C -> more outliers
- being able to train makes averages catch up to tops and slows catch up to averages more / unreleased puzzles show strengths and weaknesses more
    - for the unreleased puzzles you see a different pattern in the result distribution:
    - prelims linear -> the times increased linear
    - for unreleased rather cubic shape -> in the first and last places you have bigger margins and around the average people are more similar
## scores (explanation see excel sheet)
- Kristin Thuv wins all scores (avg_placement, avg_time=00:33:12, score_on_unreleased, overall_score) except score_before_final
- top 4 by expectation before the finals would've been (each with solid margin)
    1. Katharina Reiner
    2. Kristin Thuv
    3. Alejandro Clemente León
    4. Mercédesz Arthofer
    - then follow many people with alomst equal scores
- within the final top 20: biggest jumps made Kelly Walter (+12), Katrina Coleman (+23), Klara Wesselkamp (+46!), Melissa Townsend (+13), Cathy Roiter (+19)
- within the expected top 20: biggest drops made Markéta Freislerová (expected:6,-15), Gisela Arranz Toro (9,-48), Mari Black (13,-28), Kateřina Klinková (14,-33), Sofie Juel Andersen (18,-30)
- only 2 people in the finals placed as expected: Chiara Dellantonio (11), Rhianna Eriksen (46) 
- fastest relative time was Katharina Reiner => 41.22% of the time the average person puzzled
## did the average WJPC-participant get faster
- did the average WJPC-finalist get faster? 
    - 2022 1:08:27, 2023 1:04:35, 2024 0:58:09
- average qualification time needed
    - 2022 1:20:20, 2023 1:18:43, 2024 1:01:33
    - doesn't necessarily mean people got faster -> less people qualifying (60 of 190 vs 60 of 80) biases this evolvment
